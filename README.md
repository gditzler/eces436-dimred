# About

This repository contains a collection of Matlab and Python scripts for implementing dimensionality reductions. The purpose of this code is to: (a) demonstrate new software tools for pattern recognition and machine learning in Python, (b) demonstrate manipulations of biological data formats in Python, (c) implement basic multi-purpose modules, and (d) provide you with some code to accompony the lectures on dimensionality reduction. For the Python portion of this section, we focus on using dimensionality reduction for biological data formats (mainly metagenomic data). The Matlab scripts are a little more general and use some functions that are not built into Matlab. 

# Matlab: The Fathom Toolbox 

The [Fathom](http://www.marine.usf.edu/user/djones/matlab/matlab.html) toolbox for Matlab contains a number of multidimensional scaling routines. The toolbox can explicitly incorporate space, over multiple scales, in statistical models of ecological data using spatial eigenfunctions.  

* [Download](http://www.marine.usf.edu/user/djones/dnload/FTM.zip)

Add the Fathom toolbox contents to `matlab/Fathom/`

# Python

The Python scripts require that you have several commonly used dependencies installed if you want to run the code. We are not going to spend class time installing the programs; however, if you need help outside of the classroom installing the software, I would be more than happy to help (offer only valid for Linux and OS X users). 

* What do I need to have installed?: [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [Scipy](http://www.scipy.org/), [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
